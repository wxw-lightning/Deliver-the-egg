Deliver the egg: This is a board game. It uses dice to determine how many steps you can move. What's different from other board game is two players are moving the same object, the egg. And each player can have 3 chances to go back in order to prevent the other to get the destination.
Basic rules: 2 players take turns to roll the dice, each player must move exactly the same step as the number on dice. If the egg stop at the destination, then that player wins. If the egg reach the destination, but there are steps left, then go that amount of steps backward. The strategy is to go back. Each player has three times to go back, in order to prevent your opponent from being able to win. If the current position number is less than the number on dice and the player decide to go backward, the egg will just remain at the same place.
